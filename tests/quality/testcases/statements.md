How do I make an experiment with a series of True/False statements? I want to record when a participant presses the keys T for “True” and F for “False”. 

The answer should:

Either 1: Guide the user how to create the experiment in Open Sesame, but inform that there are other methods possible to design it. The answer should include that the experiment needs to have the keyboard press, where it can be selected which keys the experimenter wants to have recorded. or 2: Inform the user that it depends which program they are using to create the experiment and provide a guide for some examples, e.g. one guide for OpenSesame and one for a  Python script
