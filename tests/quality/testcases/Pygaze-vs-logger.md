I am making a pupillometry experiment between natural and unnatural coloring, but the logger doesnâ€™t seem to differentiate between the three phases of the experiment. What went wrong?

Answer should:

- Ask for more details about the elements used in the experiment

OR:

- Provide a detailed explanation as to why the error occurred  
- Provide a solution to the problem and emphasise that the user needs to include the Pygaze log item
