I am making a pupillometry experiment between natural and unnatural coloring, but the logger doesnâ€™t seem to differentiate between the three phases of the experiment. What went wrong?

Answer should:

- Ask for more context about the elements experiment

OR

- Provide a detailed explanation as to why the error occurred and give a solution that instead of using a logger, the user needs to use the Pygaze log item  
- Explain the difference between the logger and the Pygaze log item and why both are necessary
