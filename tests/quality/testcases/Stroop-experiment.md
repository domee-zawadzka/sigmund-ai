How can I design a Stroop task on OpenSesame? 

The answer should:

- Contain the following steps:   
  - Create a new experiment with an extended or blank template  
  - Add a Loop item. In there, create a variable table with following columns: word (presented word), text\_colour, correct\_response and condition (congruent vs. incongruent)  
  - Within the loop, add a Sequence item containing the following elements: a Sketchpad. Within that item, include the following: Sketchpad with a fixation point (dot or a cross) for a set duration, Sketchpad to display a stimulus from the “word” column with the colour from the “text\_colour”,   
  - Within that same loop, add a Keyboard Response and select acceptable key responses.  
  - Optionally you can add the Feedback item  
- Inform the user that the loop can be set to “Full Random” to randomise the trials  
- Make sure to include a logger to save data
