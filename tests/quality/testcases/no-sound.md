I have an experiment in OSWeb in which a participant has to watch a video, but there is no sound when it plays. What caused it? How can I fix the issue?

The answer should:

- Option one: ask the user about more details about the experiment (specifically the elements they used)  
- Option two: list possible causes of the problem, for example, browser restrictions, unsupported video/audio file or that OSWeb does not support the media\_player\_mpy and provide a solution for each issue.   
    
  The answer should not:   
    
- Assume a single cause of the error and provide solution for it
