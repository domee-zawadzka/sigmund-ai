How do I make an experiment where the participant has to name objects that appear on the screen?

The answer should:

- Option 1: ask the user to give more details about the experiment or Option 2: provide a detailed explanation which OpenSesame elements are needed for the experiment but inform that some elements might differ, depending on the input method of the answer, e.g. is it voice input or does the participant have to type the answer on the computer.
